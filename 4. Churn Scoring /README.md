Customer churn refers to when a customer ends his or her relationship with a business.

Why do we want to predict churn?

Acquiring new customers can be several times more expensive than selling to existing ones. Understanding what drives churn and why customers are churning is crucial in maintaining high retention rates. Being able to accurately identify those customers at high risk of churning, may help us to create appropriate marketing strategies and retain our customers.
